# Ellucian Ethos Integration Java SDK Examples

The Ethos Integration Java SDK (EIJSDK) provides utilities and libraries that make it easier for developers to quickly start building Ethos-based integrations.

This is an example library that illustrates how to use the various clients of the EIJSDK.  Some of the 
examples provided use the EIJSDK object library to enable JavaBean property access when handling API
requests/responses.  

The examples can be tweaked as needed, but should be runnable, though an API key is required to run them.
Each example class contains its own main method and can be run individually.  All example classes are found under the 
`com.ellucian.examples` package.

The `pom.xml` of this project can also be viewed to show the dependencies used for the EIJSDK object libraries, and the 
EIJSDK itself.
